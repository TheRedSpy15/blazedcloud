# How to run on Windows (x64)
Download `blazedcloud-windows-x64.zip` from https://github.com/TheRedSpy15/blazedcloud/releases/latest

Unzip, and run the `.exe` file

## Optional but recommended

Currently, there is no installer for the application. Only a portable build is provided.

Because of this, to make it easy to launch the application, it is recommended to right click the `.exe` file, and create a shortcut. Place that shortcut somewhere easy to access on your desktop (i.e home screen)

## Warning

At this time, there is no built in update function for the desktop client. We are currently in the process of publishing the client on the official Windows app store to simplify installion and provide an way for users to update their client
